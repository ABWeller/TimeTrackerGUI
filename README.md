# TimeTrackerGUI
 A simple GUI time tracker using Python and tkinter. Exports times to .txt file for archival purposes. I made this in oder to keep track of my hours working on projects

# save
saves a recording of the date, start time, end time, and total time to .txt in root folder

# issues
- antivirus can cause problems with writing to .txt file. Disable AV in source folder
- timer does not count over 24 hours, though no one should be working that long
